<sub> This program is a Game called "Taki". It is written in C. </sub>

<sub> This program was created as part of course in The Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yaffo. </sub>

Taki is a card game usually for 2 player or more (this program can be played also by one player).
There are two types of cards: 
* Numbers 1-9.
* Special cards: Taki (10),  Switch Direction(11),  Plus (12),  Stop (13),  and Switch Color (14).

Every card have it own color (Red/Blue/Green/Yellow), except the Switch color card which has not color.

For start each player receives seven cards.
Starting clockwise, each player discards a card onto the leading card, by matching its color or matching its number or figure or using a Switch Color.
A player who cannot play draws one card from the draw pile (0).
The game ends when the first player has discarded their last card.

Have fun :)
